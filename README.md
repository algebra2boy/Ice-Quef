### Front-end development of app Ice Queb

## Coding Standards
1. Please only do things in your own branch.
2. When naming variables, do not use underscores. Instead, use camelCase.
3. All functional component parameters should be contained within { },
   otherwise the code will not work.
4. Always use Kolyn components whenever possible.
5. All pages should be wrapped within the base page.
6. Write 'index.js' files whenever possible. This allows more concise imports.

## Terminology
"Page": referring to a content-rendering screen

"Component": a functional component

"Kit": the foundations of the frontend development

## JSDOCS
AKA, javascript documentations. You can set up one by typing

in your editor.

Here are some rules you need to follow when creating / editing
a JSDOCS:

1. Variables, Enums, Functions need to be documented.
2. Styling-related things are not documented.
3. You need to write a description for each JSDOCS.
4. To document an Enum, write:
   ```
   @enum { your type }
   ```
5. To document an array, write:
   ```
   @array { your type }
   ```
6. To document a parameter (and you need to write this for each parameter), write:
   ```
   @param { your type } description
   ```
7. To document function parameter, write:
   ```
   @param { func } variableName: description
   ```
8. To document return, write:
   ```
   @return { your type } description
   ```
